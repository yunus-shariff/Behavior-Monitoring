Still generates weekly average for IV and IS. Also std and coefficient of variation are calculated for daily sleep data in lieu of IV and IS\n",

    "    - Iterate over each week number (rows are already sorted by date) for the current subid\n",
    "        - use `week_df` to interpolate any missing dates and/or hours as each day must have 24 hours i.e, 168 hours each week \n",
    "        - For the interpolated data points, use mean imputation\n",
    "        - compute std and cov for each week\n",
    "     \n",
    "- There is an extra step at the beginning where the date field in `req_sleep_data` is duplicated (`report_date`). This is because we have additional dates to pad out missing dates for each week after interpolation\n",
    "    - When we generate the weekly average data in `sleep_std_cov`, we simply duplicate the std and cov computations for all dates corresponding to that week\n",
    "    - Using the `date` column would generate more duplicates resulting in computational overhead only to be dropped when merging with sleep data in subsequent steps\n",
    "    - Or if we wanted to generate weekly average data, where we have only entry per week, the date used for this record would simply be the first date for that week. If this is an interpolated date i.e., from `week_df`, any subsequent merge operation would result in a lot of dropped records due to date mismatch as we would need to join on 'subid' and 'date'\n",
