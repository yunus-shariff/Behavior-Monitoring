The cumulative goal of this project is to advance the research on  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) classification. In lieu of standardized test scores, which can yield highly accurate results, the focus is to quantify behavioral patterns, group differences (gender, geography, race, etc.,) and/or feature interactions collected from monitoring the daily living habits of older adults to reliably detect MCI, which may occur as a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. MCI may include problems with memory, language or judgement.

The dataset contains information on patients, including their age, education level, cognitive test scores, gait measurements, wearable device and PIR sensor data acquired from daily monitoring. Subjects belong to 3 cohorts OHSU, VA and MARS. 

To maintain confidentiality, the files have been withheld. However, the notebooks reflect the substantial progress towards building a model that is sensitive to nuances in patient behavior.
